# 🐰 Clinic Handbook

Welcome! This is a growing, student-friendly clinic guide designed to make real-world clinical learning feel a little more calm, clear, and doable.

<div class="callout">
💗 **My goal:** Build a practical, easy-to-navigate resource for medical (and future PA) students with clinic essentials—how to prepare, how to present, how to document, and how to think through common scenarios with confidence.
</div>

## What you’ll find here
- **Clinic basics** (workflow, expectations, time-saving habits)
- **Communication templates** (presentations, patient-friendly phrasing, return precautions)
- **Documentation help** (HPI structure, assessment/plan organization, common pitfalls)
- **High-yield reminders** (red flags, “don’t forget” checklists, clinical pearls)

## Start here
- 👉 **[Medical Students](./medical-students/)**
