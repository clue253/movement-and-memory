# Medical Students: Clinic Essentials

## Before clinic (the “don’t be stressed” checklist)
- Add Dr. Morgan's Schedule (MOB4MA, MOBN2F, MOBNGMA)
- Only prior knowledge you may need is how to run a MoCa
- If you get a new pt, make sure to give them the info sheet that includes our clinic phone number and other information (first file folder in yellow or blue binder)

## People to Know
- Caty: Scribe
- Erica: Social Worker
- Deva: Fellow

## Clinic Layout
- Clinic is scheduled to have one person each visit a pt and present to the physician before seeing the next pt.
- In clinic we see Memory (AD) and Movement (PD) disorders, which can be determined based on the schedule or referral.
- It is your responsibility to write the note of the pt you see. Notes are due a week after they are started.
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask as we are all here to help!

- Since the physician is pretty chill don't stress about this too much!

## Notes & Format
- In notes, click in the dropdown of create note -> and chose standard visit note
- Patient ID: This should include 2 sentences of the pt name, age, whether they are (presenting/returning) to clinic, what are we treating them for, pt PMHx, and whether they are here for (f/u, referral, or review results). The second sentence should include who is accompanying them.
- HPI: Paragraph form of anything you believe is pertinent for the pt chart based on the prior questions above. Medications should be included in a header/bullet point format. Current medications should include the name, number of tablets taken, and what time of day they are taken. Trialed medications should include the name and reason they stopped taking them. Additionally, any test information (MRI, amyloid PET scan, CT scan, labs) that were from a prior visit or reviewed this visit should be either copied from the last visit and place here OR create a header for the test/lab + date completed and underneath copy and paste the impression results.
- ROS: Can be taken from prior note, from ROS smartphrase template, and editted based on pt presentation.
- Physical exam: Can be taken from prior note, from Physical exam smartphrase template, and editted based on pt presentation. Speficially we include the pt MoCa and gait in this section that is often editted. With MoCas please include the date they were done and what they're score was overall and what their score was on delayed recall.
- Assessment: Copy Patient ID. One to two sentence summary of pt chief complaints from HPI. IF a MoCa was done, an updated score, else no sentence here. Sentence of changes or lack of change in physical exam. Description of results seen today from tests, scans, or labs. And then finally you will have a sentence stating **"Today we plan to BLANK."** This is where you will officially describe the plan post visit. Any diagnoses, books, assistance items provided by the social worker, test, labs, scans, or medications prescribed should be written here. It should follow the format of THIS WAS GIVEN FOR X REASON. The last sentence should say **"Pt will RTC in BLANK months for f/u for REASON."**
