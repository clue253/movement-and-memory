## 🧠 Cognitive Tests: MoCA
- MoCA is typically done **yearly**
- You can skip if:
  1) medical concerns make it an unfair assessment, **or**
  2) patient is **< 12/30**
- MoCAs are in the **first folder in the pink binder** (v7.1) — ask us to print more if needed
- If patient remembers the MoCA, use the alternate version **v7.2**
