# Medical Students: Clinic Essentials

## Before clinic (the “don’t be stressed” checklist)
- Know the schedule + who you’re seeing
- Review problem list, meds, recent labs/imaging
- Identify your “1–2 goals” for each patient

## In the room (what to actually do)
- Start with chief concern + agenda setting
- Focused history (timeline, red flags, functional impact)
- Relevant ROS + med reconciliation
- Focused exam tied to the complaint

## Presenting to the preceptor
Use: **1-liner → key HPI → relevant exam → assessment → plan**
- Lead with your strongest diagnosis + why
- Offer a backup differential (2–3 options)
- Propose a plan (tests + treatment + follow-up)

## Documentation basics
- HPI: chronological, symptom-focused, concise
- Assessment: problem-based
- Plan: actionable, includes patient education + return precautions

## Common pitfalls
- Too much irrelevant ROS
- Forgetting meds/allergies
- No clear question for the preceptor
